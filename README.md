### Aims :
 - The main aim of this project is to write a clearly structured single-page web application.  
   To practice using APIs to access remote services, manipulating JSON and arrays, manipulating the DOM, and incorporating the results into your web application.

#### Features:
 - Player Customization:
    - Players enter their name and select the quiz category and difficulty level.
    - A “Start Quiz” button initiates the game.
 - Gameplay Mechanics:
 The quiz consists of 10 multiple-choice questions per round.
 Players have 10 seconds to answer each question.
 If a player fails to answer within the time limit, they lose the chance to earn points for that question.
 
 - Feedback on Answers:
 After submitting an answer, players receive immediate feedback on whether their answer is correct or incorrect.
 A scoreboard displays the count of correct answers out of 10 and the total score.
 
 - Game Over Conditions:
 If a player answers incorrectly, a red cross is displayed.
 The game ends if the player receives three red crosses.
 
 - Game Options:
  Players can choose to stop the quiz at any time or finish all ten questions.
  Upon completion, the score is displayed, and players can start a “New Game.”
 
 - Leaderboard:
 After a game ends, players are taken back to the start page, where their name and score are displayed on the leaderboard.
 
 - Assistance Tools:
 Two yellow buttons assist players during the game:
 One button crosses out some incorrect answers.
 The other stops the 10-second timer, granting players one additional minute to find the correct answer.
 Each assistance tool can be used only once during the game.
